                    <li>
                        <b>Face cleansing</b> – Indian brides loves to carry a
                        bold and bright colors for their wedding. Some brides go
                        for a bold and bright makeup while others just love the
                        subtle and nude makeup look. In order to make your face
                        look natural and glowing you have to follow a face
                        cleansing routine before your wedding. An exfoliated
                        skin is always the best to carry the makeup.

                    <li>
                        <b>Moisturize</b> – You have to keep your skin
                        moisturized so that when you apply makeup it does not
                        look chapped and dull. Depending upon your skin type,
                        select a moisturizer that suits you best. The dry skin
                        people require the extra moisture as compared to the
                        oily skin ones. Do not apply moisturizer in access or
                        else your kin will appear more oily and greasy.

                        moisturizers that keep your skin moisturized and
                        hydrated as well but if you are fond of that natural
                        glow on your face, you will have to keep your skin
                        hydrated from within. The easiest and the most obvious
                        way of keeping yourself hydrated is Water! Water! Water!
                        You will have to drink lots of water daily not matter if
                        it is summers or winters month.

                <h2>Indian Wedding Dresses</h2>
                <p>
                    Indian wedding dresses are the most vibrant, colorful and
                    glamorous wedding dresses in the whole wide world. The
                    brides usually used to go for a beautiful red color but with
                    the changing time the tastes, preferences and trends have
                    changed a lot. Nowadays many brides love to wear pink, white
                    or any color other than red. The Indian brides are always
                    expected to sparkle on her big day so her dress is designed
                    in a manner that supports the glam she wanted to carry.
                    Indian wedding dresses are very colorful with intricate
                    designs and embroidery. They are made from the fabric that
                    reflects the light very well. The most widely used fabric
                    for India wedding dresses is satin, silk, or chiffon. You
                    can find dresses with artistic work like that of organza,
                    zardosy, sequins, cut work, mirror work, pearl work, kasab,
                    kundan work, etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The myth that people used to believe regarding the color
                    dress is that it is associated with good luck and is
                    believed to bring the couple much happiness in future life
                    but this is not true. “A color cannot decide your future” is
                    the slogan of today’s time and people have started believing
                    in facts rather than the superstitions and stereotypes.

                <h1>Why You Should Have a Pre-Wedding Shoot?</h1>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Pre-Wedding Shoot is often referred to as “Engagement
                    shoot”. This photo shoot is usually done 3-6 months prior to
                    your wedding. Though Pre-Wedding Shoot is an emerging trend,
                    many couples are debating on it. Whether they should go for
                    a Pre-wedding shoot or not is the hot topic of today’s time.
                    Some couples are of the opinion that the Pre-Wedding Shoot
                    is just a wastage of money and nothing more than that. While
                    others think that it is a beautiful memory that lasts for a
                    lifetime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pre-wedding shoot can prove to be helpful in quite different
                    ways. If you are hiring the same photographer to document
                    your wedding then the pre-wedding shoot will help you in
                    building up a good rapport with the photographer. You’ll get
                    to know the skills of the photographer which can help you
                    change your decision if you find the photographer
                    unprofessional and uncomfortable to deal with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The photographer gets the opportunity during the pre-wedding
                    shoot to understand your bond, love, and affection which
                    help him create a setting that will flatter both of you not
                    only in the pre-wedding shoot but also you can rock your
                    wedding shoot too!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pre-wedding shoot also provides romantic and memorable
                    moments to the couples. They can rejoice in the chemistry
                    and spark of their relation which is rarely possible in all
                    the wedding hustles.

                <h2>Best Pre-Wedding Photography</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The best photography is probably the one which you find the
                    best. Every person has a different choice and taste, what
                    one finds attractive cannot be the same for others. There
                    are different themes and concepts of pre-wedding photography
                    which you can select depending upon what suits you the most.
                    The best photography depends upon two things –
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The pictures should be able to tell the love story of
                        the couple.
                    </li>
                    <li>The way in which emotions are captured by the lens.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src={z4} alt="" />

                <p>
                    The following rundown will help you know about the themes
                    and concepts of pre-wedding photography:
                </p>
                <h3>Traditional</h3>
                <p>
                    This type of concept helps you to reach the roots of your
                    culture’s heritage and help you display the culture-rich
                    elements in the photos. This theme or concept is most apt
                    for the couples who are planning to get married in a
                    traditional way. In this type of photography, locations
                    which are rich in cultural heritage are picked to get those
                    antique vibes of the culture.
                </p>
                <h3>Glamorous</h3>
                <p>
                    When you are choosing the glamorous concept it means that
                    there will be glamorous dresses and grand location. This
                    pre-wedding photography is shot on exotic locations creating
                    a proper filmy feel. This photography is best for the
                    couples who choose elegance and sophistication above all
                    other things.
                </p>
                <h3>Casual</h3>
                <p>
                    As the name suggests, casual photography is just the
                    opposite of the glamorous concept. Unlike the glamorous
                    concept, casual concept is all about charm and modesty.
                    There are different themes within this concept. Some couples
                    re-enact the moment when they first met, others portray
                    their hobbies while some others choose to showcase the
                    things they did on their first date.
                </p>

                    sparkle and glitters. They are often designed in bold colors
                    which makes them distinct in every aspect. The hand-work
                    customized by the craftsmen makes them more appealing and
                    unique. There is no place in the whole wide world where such
                    a variety in wedding dress designs and the type of work done
                    on them is available other than India.

                <h2>What you should think before you buy a Wedding Dress?</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Every bride has some inspiration regarding the bridal dress.
                    In the hustle of wedding preparations you need to keep in
                    mind the following things:
                </p>
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Choose yourself</strong> – There is a custom in
                        India wherein the dress of the bride is selected by the
                        in-laws or the relatives. You don’t have to disregard
                        this custom but what you can do is tell your likes,
                        dislikes, and preferences to them or the best option
                        will be to go along for shopping with them. Even if you
                        are not able to go for shopping, we always have
                        WhatsApp. Just make sure that the outfit is selected
                        according to your choice because it’s your day and you
                        have to slay and look perfect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Color</strong> – Decide the color of your dress
                        before you are going to buy it. The color plays a major
                        role in the grace and look of the dress. The most
                        favorite and widely preferred color for wedding dresses
                        in India is red. However, the trends have changed the
                        theme of red to many other vibrant colors. Discuss it
                        with your partner and decide on a common color that you
                        both will be carrying as the color-coordinated couples
                        look the best, in person as well as in the photographs.

                <p>
                    No wedding is ever complete without the fun and frolic of
                    music and dance. The wedding season calls for cheers and
                    celebrations which is incomplete without the grooves and
                    moves on the songs. Bollywood songs are most apt for the
                    functions of Indian weddings which are full of joys and
                    enjoyments. When your wedding is just round the corner the
                    toughest part is to select the best songs for the dance
                    performances. A wide variety and genres of songs are
                    required for different-different dance performances.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Songs depend upon the type of performance you will be giving
                    on the sangeet or mehendi function. Generally, sangeet
                    function is organized particularly for ladies. The selection
                    of different songs is a difficult task wherein you require a
                    romantic song for the couple, typical bollywood songs for
                    the bridesmaid and emotional songs for the parents of the
                    couple.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Weddings call for the completion of lots of tasks. People
                    are hardly left with time to finish off other related tasks.
                    In such a situation if you get a playlist ready for your big
                    day then do not consider it less than a “blessing in
                    disguise”. A lot of stress is gone if you get a handy
                    playlist.

                <p>
                    Wedding reception or marriage reception is a party held
                    after the marriage ceremony to receive society as a married
                    couple. It is a gesture of hospitality for those who
                    attended the wedding ceremony. The reception is often the
                    first public appearance of the newlywed couple.

                    The celebrations of reception in India are unique with a
                    charm of their own. Traditionally, organized by the groom's
                    family, the reception is a grand party where friends and
                    associates from the groom's side attend. It serves as an
                    opportunity for the bride to meet the groom's acquaintances.

                <h2>Why Should We Have Destination Weddings?</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Everyone creates their own fairytale of how their wedding
                    will be like. Some dream of a royal and luxurious wedding
                    while others dream of a very calm and subtle kind of an
                    environment for their wedding. The preferences and choices
                    for their big day vary depending upon the budget set by
                    them. Many latest trends has been set and followed by the
                    couples and one of the most popular trends in today’s time
                    is that of a destination wedding. Destination weddings are
                    those weddings that are held in a far off place, other than
                    your hometown. These weddings tend to be more intimate as
                    compared to the traditional weddings and hence making it
                    more affordable and cheaper.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Planning of a destination wedding is different from planning
                    the regular weddings. It removes many of the stresses that
                    are there in regular wedding. It also provides an
                    opportunity to the couples to celebrate their day in the
                    best way possible away from all the tensions of work and
                    daily routine. Destination weddings can be intimate (just
                    the two of you), limited to close family and friends, or a
                    grand affair with hundreds of guests attending your wedding.

                <br />
                <p>
                    Weddings tend to be the most talked-about and the most
                    memorable event of everybody’s life. It is like a fairy-tale
                    that every girl dreams about. To make it the most happening
                    day of life it is important that the planning has been done
                    in the most accurate manner.
                </p>

                <p>
                    India is a culturally and traditionally rich country and so
                    are the weddings here. Many traditions, customs and rituals
                    are practiced among the different castes, religions and
                    states. Weddings in India generally involve a series of
                    functions leading to the “D-day” so a single wedding lasts
                    for 3-4 days.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is difficult to manage a 3-4 days long wedding all by
                    yourself so, people definitely require assistance in
                    completing a long queue of tasks for the wedding. Many
                    people take this assistance from their family members but in
                    today’s time it is very difficult to spare time so people
                    hire a trained and professional person who is known as a
                    wedding planner.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Technically, a wedding planner is a professional who helps
                    with the design, planning and management of a client’s
                    wedding against some amount. They are hired by the couples
                    who work long hours and have little spare time available for
                    sourcing and managing wedding venues and suppliers. They
                    usually charge a percentage of the total cost of the wedding
                    or some fees.
